## Instructions
1. Turn the switch to "on"
2. Hit the "ok/mute" button on the remote controll
3. The LEDs will light up, and the buzzer will sound!
4. BE CAREFUL. This circuit has a Lithium-Ion battery. If this battery is punctured or damaged IT COULD EXPLODE.
5. To charge, connect a micro-USB cable to the micro-USB port. When the battery is fully charged, a light on the back will glow green.
6. With a fully charged battery, this should last at least 3 hours (but probably more).

Notes:
IR signal captured using raw_ir_receive.
Tone produced (ab)using this [ToneAC library](https://bitbucket.org/teckel12/arduino-toneac/wiki/Home) because of [this Multiple Definition of "__vector_7" Error](https://bitbucket.org/teckel12/arduino-new-ping/wiki/Multiple%20Definition%20of%20%22__vector_7%22%20Error) when trying to use the built-in tone library.

Replaced the original buzzer above with this [Piezo Buzzer from Sparkfun.](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/7950) (where users say: a) Itâ€™s loudest at 2048Hz, and b) drive it with a transistor and include the diode (see schematic in datasheet))
